Fine grained but present tannins that are not fully resolved, and the tannins and maybe a little sediment gave a powdery texture to the wine. Spice and menthol with some tobacco and richer notes. I got red fruit as much as black. Simultaneously light and elegant but rich and profound. Maybe in a few years the tannins get more resolved and the sediment/powdery thing might go away. It didn't really bother me but it was noticeable and kept it from perfection because it distracted from the spectrum of flavors that were there just a hint.

The tannins are fully assimilated at this point, lending soft textures to the dense midpalate and lengthy finish. What a pleasant surprise!

I have been a big fan of Troon for a while now and with each vintage, every visit, even the slightest interaction, that admiration grows. While researching this wine, I noticed that Troon not only published the bottle weight (which I have *never* seen before), they also mention that the label is \"tree free\". All of this, of course, in addition to the fact that the farm is 100% Demeter certified biodynamic and Regenerative Organic Certified\u00ae. Yowza. And it shows in both the people and the wine. This Druid's White is gorgeous on the nose with green apple and tropical fruits billowing over the rim. The palate leans more tropical with guava and mango performing a lovely pas-\u00e0-deux, with a zingy tartness keeping everything in line from the start. This is, once again, the best Druid's white thus far; I say that every year because it just keeps getting better. Outstanding. 93 Points.\n\nwww.thedrunkencyclist.com",

There's a dark note that's particularly stout-like, and the alcohol character is muting a bit more of the barleywine notes than I'd prefer. But I expect this will round out nicely in time.",

    "Review": "QPR Search\n\nI recently purchased two mixed cases of wine, 18 of which were single bottles, with the objective of discovering daily drinkers (and more) that I can buy by the case to have on hand. The basic criteria was WA rating >90 and price <$20. This one was RP 92+ and $17.99.\n\nA bit of a conundrum. Boring when initially opened. But after 10-15 minutes of air, it became very nice. Nose of pineapple-upside down cake, lemon, some minerality, some spice. Frankly, it reminded me of a mid-teens Kistler Chardonnay, or perhaps its younger sibling. Some midpalate viscosity, and finishing with some tart lemon. So I get oak on the nose but none at all on the finish.\n\nEven more confusing is the back label: Glenelly \u201cwas purchased in 2003 by May de Lenquesaing, former owner of the iconic Chateau Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande in France,\u201d which suggests a commitment to quality. But then \u201cDrink now until 2022 and beyond for the most delicate palates\u2026\u201d which suggests to me that the wine is not ageworthy. This is a 2021 wine\u2014drink until 2022? And after that it\u2019s only for \u201cthe most delicate palates?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m glad I tried it, and will do so again, but this one isn\u2019t making my QPR list.",

Quite complex with an intoxicating nose that evolved over three nights into three distinct profiles, though it was at its finest (in my opinion) upon opening. I just kept staring at the glass. Super-concentrated without losing it's balance. Plenty of red and some black fruit on night one, with the blackest taking over on night three.

Cherry flavored red fruits, some sweet notes but a strong acid feel in the mouth without tartness. For Napa Medium weight. This does not seem to me to be heavily barreled, no char, tobacco notes but maybe a touch on vanillin. Generally, a pleasing wine that is best enjoyed with time sniffing often. This is outside my normal big hedonistic Napa fare. Right bank, so I assume this is Merlot dominated which tracks with the experience. 91-92 HMC",

    "Wine Name": "NV Filliers 17 Years Old Barrel-Aged Genever",
    "Review": "A genever aged for 17 years in American oak barrels. 44% alcohol.\n\nMedium-deep honey-yellow color. The nose feels evolved, complex and wonderfully fine-tuned with layered aromas of butterscotch, some dusty wood, a little bit of ripe yellow fruit, light honeyed nuances, a hint of exotic spices and a touch of caramel. The genever feels quite dry, spicy and somewhat woody on the palate with a medium body and rather pronounced flavors of dusty old wood, some sweet yellow-toned fruit notes, a little bit of peppery spice, light grainy malt nuances, sweeter hints of butterscotch and honey and a toasty touch of caramel oak. The high alcohol lends some heat to the palate. The finish is long, complex and hot with a layered aftertaste of grainy malt and woody notes of savory oak spice, some peppery tones, a little bit of sweet yellow fruit, light honeyed nuances and oaky hints of toffee and vanilla.\n\nA terrific and surprisingly whisky-like genever where the actual genever qualities have been more or less overwhelmed by the oak aging. Not that I mind - I like whiskies and this drinks more like a whisky than a genever (or a Bourbon, which seems to be the kind of style in which oak-aged genevers are often made)! Furthermore, even if there is a little bit of sweetness, I think the overall flavor profile is drier and less saccharine as seems to be typical for many genevers. While I think that genevers carry their sweetness surprisingly well, this more spicy-and-savory (rather than rich and sweet) kind of style speaks to me a bit more. Good stuff. Recommended.",

A couple hours in it mellowed some and was more integrated. More fruit and less perfume on the nose, while the palate showed bitter dark chocolate. By hour 3 it was all integrated and super delicious!",

On the finish, the wine then presents fine notes of root vegetables and hints of creaminess.\n\nPalate: Fresh yellow apple and touches of yuzu cream touch the palate at first, notes of herbs, crushed stones and grated nuts take over afterwards. Fresh acidity and noticeable salinity. The finish then shows notes of smoke, savoury herbs, minerality and dried apples.\n\nVery indicative of Neumeisters style. The wine appears shy in the beginning, but after a bit of inquiry, it starts to unravel its complex set of aromas. Here, the nose mainly shows savoury nuances and heaps of minerality, a bit of fruit and floral nuances are in the background. On the palate, the wine is much more expressive from the get-go, showing a mix of fruity and savoury characteristics, the acidity and salinity add great structure.

It features a ripe, honeyed nose, but comes across as more linear/one-dimensional on the palate on the palate. To this point, this might be the weakest Pouilly-Fuisse I've tasted in Barraud's '23 lineup, although it's pleasant enough so I don't want to seem like I'm being overly critical. Perhaps best summed up as being drinkable but only mildly interesting.\n\nOne other footnote here - I believe this is the 4th different cork I've come across used by Barraud in this vintage. This one happens to be artificial of some sort, and the cork indicated it was made from 100% recyclable components.",

Close to medium bodied (12.5% ABV) with open white apple upfront, adding a bit of pear through the middle and showing much more cleanly than I expected. Given the nose, I was expecting it to be a bit more funky, but instead it showed cleanly and very well balanced. Good structure on the back consisting of moderate acidity and tart white orchard fruit notes. My overall impressions were very positive with the wine showing brightly upfront and depth through the middle with good overall balance and a generally unique style. Given how young this wine is, I may consider picking up a few bottles for myself to see how it evolves. I expect it should drink well over the next 5+ years.

The structure keeps pace with the fruit with the acidity, lemon and grapefruit working together to provide overall balance to the wine. It's two main strengths were how clean, bright and open the mid-body fruit was and how well the fruit and structure worked together. Drinking very well at present but will improve over the next few years and has a number of additional years beyond that at the current, high level. (Bin 152 Wine Bar; Charleston, South Carolina).",

Medium gold, full bodied, thick legs. Medium+ acidity, more noticeable as the wine got below cellar temperature, no heat. VG+ complexity, intensity and persistence. This came out of the bottle a bit discombobulated, with its elements not playing nicely with each other, but a couple+ hours of air and cooling really helped things, which continued to get better through a second night. A bit of a different feel for me that the other bottles, with the wine showing an almost cottony texture over the more typical Aubert creaminess. With the air, really nice on its own, but very good with a broiled salmon one night, even better with a seafood risotto another, with the relative richness of the food and wine complementing each other. I\u2019d be more inclined to sit this for a year or two if I had more (I have 2 \u201822s, but didn\u2019t order the \u201823) with hopes for a bit smoother delivery, but with small sample size, this is probably myt least favorite Aubert SVD chard (for those holding their collective breaths to know my order, like Zimmy, Lauren, CIX, Park Avenue, tie between UV-SL and Powder House, Larry Hyde and this; I haven\u2019t had Sugar Shack nor the 2 discontinued bottlings Zimmy mentions). Of course, in my world, even a relatively lesser SVD from Aubert is still a fine wine, just a little less so in the context of some of Mark\u2019s other efforts, Leeuwin\u2019s Art Series, Sphaerics and perhaps most of all, Luc\u2019s CdCs. 93-94+",

Medium bodied with very clean, bright and expressive white apple upfront and then adding white melon and pear through the middle. The pear and melon, while well-defined have a softer edge to them (as opposed to being really sharply, acidity-defined) which led to better integration and balance. Very good balancing acidity on the back as well as tart white fruit notes (not citrus) leading to a very mineral driven finish with some earth notes behind (oak not noticeable on the finish tonight). Overall, this confirmed my impressions from the prior night that this wine has the fruit, structure, balance and nuance to drink very well for a number of years to come.

    "Review": "(Tasted Blind): Deep garnet colour. The nose presents deep raspberry, loganberry, and redcurrant flavours that segue into pencil shavings, tilled soil, and dark (85%) chocolate.\nWith very ripe sweet fruits, the wine is full-bodied, opulent and generous but tempered with a lively cucumber acidity and a clay coolness that keeps it fresh and intense. There is depth in the mid-palate as the palate combines earthy, chalky and olive stone nuances with chewy, compact tannins. It feels seamless as it extends into the distance, complex and purposeful. It still needs some time; the layers are building as it closes with red fruit pudding and a hint of toffee.\nBlend of 80% Merlot, 10% CS, 10% CF. Alc: 14.79%; RS: 2.39; pH: 3.62; TA: 4.46",

The mid-palate feels more tertiary, with some autumn leaves mixing with soy, black olive tapenade, pencil shavings, liquorice, and coffee grounds.

The palate shows slightly muddied flavours, not quite the purity of a top vintage. There is a sweetness of fruit on entry with plenty of dark chocolate, cassis and cayenne spice. Supported by dense puckering tannins and moderate acidity, the wine comes across as hot, liquoruous, and a little one-dimensional. Despite the sweetness on the back palate and a relatively long finish, it was less impressive, given its pedigree.\n70% Merlot, 20% CF, 10 CS.

There is some sweet glycerol to this powerful, intense wine. It has an incredible depth of fruit with penetrating liquorice, cassis, and graphite notes supported by lively acidity and gravelly tannins. Despite its age, the tannins seem quite extracted, giving it a puckering, chewy dry feel, thus closing out the finish marginally sooner than expected.

The five more modern-leaning Sangiovese wines did not that age well, often showing oxidation or drying wood tannins. The same issue seen in overripe, over-extracted, oak-heavy wines from other regions (think \u201cParkerized\u201d Right Bank Bordeaux). In contrast, none of the six traditional producers had these problems. 4) Avoid Merlot at all costs. The Super Tuscans are not yet ready but packed with potential, especially Ornellaia. The Merlot-based wines were the exception, with both L\u2019Apparita and Redigaffi oxidized. For Redigaffi, this is becoming a pattern, as the 2000, 2008, 2010, and 2015 all showed oxidation.\n\nTN: The nose is muted. The palate is much more expressive. The fruit is a mix of red, blue, and dark berries, with loads of substance but in desperate need of time. The definition is fine, and the potential is enormous. There is ample freshness and a massive wall of fine tannins. This will need at least 10-15 years more time to get to its peak. For me the Super Tuscan with the most potential, ahead of the Paleo and Sassicaia.",

On days two to four it developed more reassuring clarety and savoury notes.\n\nCh. Beaumont is located roughly in the middle of that 15km stretch of no man\u2019s land between the communes of Margaux and St-Julien. The wine\u2019s lack of complexity is testament to its inferior terroir compared to wines from these two famous communes, and this Beaumont plays second fiddle to a wine like Ch Du Glana, a cru bourgeois from St-Julien, but in any case Beaumont has never had any delusions of grandeur. It is still a nice claret, albeit from a hot & ripe vintage. I am not thrilled to drink the rest of them frankly, but it is a good 'house wine' to have on hand.

Slightly candied of course on the nose and palate, but the aromatics were so lifted and singular that I finally understood the Rayas comparison.",

Additional complexity of spices. The palate is fresh acids balancing firm, structural tannin. The texture is soft. Adding notes of black tea. The Rayas signature aroma topology was very much present with a pure, red berry fruit and herbal base \u2013 but in this particular vintage (or bottle\u2026) the profile did show traces of cooked fruit which I did not like. Nonetheless, the palate was once more a real show-stopper with the tension, absolutely impeccable balance and spectacular fruit that makes you smack your lips with every sip. While never saying No to a Rayas, I have preferred 2008 and 2010 so far.",

Ancillary aromas of vegetal notes such as green bell pepper, forest floor and a fine layers of spice, interlaced with iodine minerality. A nicely juicy palate, soft and seamlessly integrated tannins, fresh acidity and a fresh fruit. Compared to Dominus in the 90ies this was maybe not quite at the stratospheric levels of 1991, 1992 and 1994, but more or less on a par with 1996. As main difference to 1996 I would point out a slightly more classic aroma profile with a bigger emphasis on vegetal notes than fresher eucalyptus and less pronounced sweet spice.",

Shows very deep, but balanced black cherry and a moderate amount of earth on the nose. Medium bodied (13.5% ABV) with lots of mixed and nuanced red cherry notes upfront, moving to dark red cherry and adding black cherry through the middle. Lots of depth here and supported by tart red cherry as well as plenty of spices an acidity for both structure and contrast. This is again a young wine and will need some time to integrate and fully come together to show off the fruit and structure to its best advantage. That said, it's already showing well at present (especially with some time open) and has a good amount of positive evolutionary potential. (Bin 152 Wine Bar; Charleston, South Carolina).",

No experience with similar wines but imagine this to be at the start of a long drinking window (but why wait?). Very elegant, very complex, very unique. Effortless.

And really rather good fruit, considering the age. You could spend all evening just inhaling this. But then it was positively violent with oak. An assault on the tongue and an assault on propriety. A criminal attack. A terrible error of judgment, because the fruit was superb in 2009. Why destroy it? An example of how to destroy grapes of perfect provenance with lashings of woody barrel flavours. Very disappointing!

Between light and medium bodied (13% ABV) with spicy red cherry upfront adding depth and a bit more fruit expression through the middle. Lots of acidity as well as tart red cherry on the back along with structural tannins. Right now, this wine isn't drinking as well as the 2020 Nudant NSG but it feels like a lot of the complexity, fruit expression and balance has yet to be revealed. This wine is still quite young and with another two years or so, I could see a mid-body with a bit more depth and noticeably more fruit expression and better overall balance. Ultimately, given where the elements are today, I think this will be the superior wine (and may even rate higher), but it will require a bit of time and patience.

    "Review": "Presented double-blind at Tasting Group. The wine appears a deep garnet color with a near opaque core with significant rim variation. Medium+ viscosity with light staining of the tears and some signs of sediment. On the nose, the wine is vinous with notes of desiccated and ripe black and red fruits: wisened blackberries and raspberries, prune, leather, tobacco, earth, baking spices. On the palate, the wine is dry with medium+ tannin and medium+ acid. Confirming the notes from the nose. The finish is medium. Initial conclusions: this has got at least 30+ years of age; certainly seen substantial new French oak and while the fruit was abundant, it\u2019s fading. Hmmm\u2026it could be Cabernet Sauvignon-based from a warm climate in an otherwise challenging year. The color, staining, oak treatment and structure basically lead me to Bordeaux varieties so I was vacillating between Napa or Bordeaux. However, I felt like there was enough fruit and power to call Napa with 30+ years of age. LOL\u2026wow. 1997 Marchesi\u2026smh. Sadly, it makes sense. The solar nature of 1997 have the power and oak treatment from this producer was firmly in the modern camp by this time. This is why I\u2019m not attracted to Barolo made in this style. It could be from anywhere. So thankful there is a shift back towards more traditional techniques by so many in Piemonte. A good wine\u2026just no sense of place. Drink now.",

    "Review": "A Room With a Vieux\n\nStrange that I finally am writing about a ten-year-old wine, and it\u2019s not a red!\n\nMaybe being French had something to do with the fact that I left this wine to cellar for so many years (remember, 10 years is a lot at my age). Maybe it was the fact that I love white Rhone wines and I didn\u2019t want to drink it. Whatever the reason, something just told me it was time. No, I\u2019m not hearing things or having people talk to me in my sleep.\n\nIt was just time for today\u2019s wine:\n\nDomaine du Vieux Telegraphe \"La Crau\" Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape Blanc 2015\n\nThe Brunier family is legendary, having been rooted in the plateau known as La Crau for over a century, where this blend of 40% Clairette, 30% Grenache Blanc, 15% Bourboulenc, and 15% Roussanne hails from. Aging is carried out in cement tanks for 10 months, and then ages for another 12 months in foudres.\n\nAfter that, and the additional cellar aging, the wine showed a deep golden hue in the glass, almost to the extent that I had misgivings that I had waited too long. Upon the first sip, I did notice certain oxidized notes. While stoned fruit such as peach and pear were present, there was a slight woody/nuttiness that seemed to suggest I might be correct. It wasn\u2019t offputting and those notes did dissipate as time went along, but never disappeared entirely.\n\nMy cellaring, while not perfect, shouldn\u2019t have caused any oxidation, but then again, you never know. Interestingly, 5 years ago I reviewed this wine for the first time and a reflection on my notes should have alerted me to its age. If you\u2019re sitting on this wine, you may want to give some thought to popping one open to see for yourself.\n\nReceiving three 95-Point reviews, a quick check showed that one reviewer said it should last a couple of decades while another said drink by 2019, maybe I should have checked that sooner!\n\nDon\u2019t let my review sour you on this wine, newer vintages have received excellent reviews, you just might want to think about drinking it sooner rather than later.\n\nCheers",

The taste has flavours of the same red fruits, more vanilla and tobacco, but also nice spicy hints like clove and a bit of rosemary. The finish has a great acidity, good length. Nice wine!",

Always delighted to drink one of these! Flighted w/a group of top village red burgs: Roumier C-M, Mugnier C-M, Meo V-R, Fourrier G-C, & Rousseau G-C. What a fascinating contrast in producer styles in this killer flight! All 05s & all quite different. When the producer picked, how much wood etc yields 5 diff '05s. Tonight this was true to Freddie w/ its silky, feather weight elegance. A little slow out of the gate but it came around as the evening progressed. Mugnier wrote the book on Chambolle lace and it all here tonight. Depending on your yearning for fruit it could have used more, or you see it as delicate & judicious as I did tonight. Very mineral and pretty. Side by side with the Roumier I'll take the Roumier but I love this non the less. Thanks Siggy. This might be at its peak or slightly beyond or just the least fruity of the 5CMs tonight side by side :)",

However, as Bols advertises this spirit as a genever, I imagine it contains some juniper. The base contains at least 51% of malt wine, ie. distilled malt spirit, blended together with some grain spirit. Aged for at least ten years in Limousin oak barrels. Bottle #43717. 38% alcohol.\n\nMedium-deep bronze color. The nose feels fascinating with complex aromas of woody oak spice reminiscent of Armagnac, some green coniferous notes of juniper, a little bit of honeycomb, light dusty and vaguely cedary wood tones, a hint of ripe nectarine, a touch of apple jam and a faint whiff of sweeter spices. The genever feels somewhat sweet yet also firm on the palate with a medium body and intense, quite savory flavors of wood spice and cedar, some caramel, light dried-fruit nuances, a little bit of ripe nectarine, fragrant hints of dried flowers and a touch of sweet Christmas spices. The finish is dry, spicy and slightly warm with a long, complex aftertaste of caramel and savory wood spice, some vanilla, light sweeter notes of dried pineapple and other dried fruits, a little bit of herbal bitterness, a hint of juicy nectarine and a faint green touch of juniper.\n\nA fascinating, complex spirit that feels quite Armagnac-like with its spicy, woody and dusty overall character - yet there is that juniper-y undertone that keeps this firmly grounded as a genever. A very tasty and captivating distillate that might speak really well to the fans of Armagnac, Cognac and Highland Whisky. At least I enjoyed this quite a lot.",

The genever feels moderately sweet and slightly viscous on the palate with a rather full body and layered flavors of ripe peachy stone fruit and honeyed richness, some woody tones, a little bit of peppery spice, light cooling green-toned botanicals like peppermint and Sichuan pepper, oaky hints of vanilla, butterscotch and Cognac and a touch of grainy malt character. The finish is spicy, woody and slightly sweet with a long, complex aftertaste of vanilla and woody oak, some honeyed tones, a little bit of apricot, light grainy notes of malt, green-toned botanical hints of peppermint and Sichuan pepper and a touch of caramel.\n\nA nice, characterful and complex barrel-aged genever that combines vaguely gin-like botanicals with Bourbon-like vanilla and caramel tones with more spicy and woody nuances reminiscent of Cognac or whisky. There's a little bit of sugary sweetness, but that doesn't really make the spirit feel any liqueuer-ish, but instead only accentuates those sweeter honeyed and caramelly nuances of oak.

    "Review": "[tasted blind]\n\npale gold. moderate intensity in nose and palate with youthful aromas and flavours of lemon, green apple, ripening pear with touches of wet stones and whispers of cream and spice. in mouth it is dry, with smooth medium body, high acidity, moderate alcohol, impressive balance and long finish. good complexity with layers or orchard fruit and minerality delineated by the acidity and the subtle \"kiss of wood\" spice. good potential for development.\n\n[my first thought was this could be a \"new wave\" Chardonnay \u2013 which has the entire wine map (including Burgundy) as possible source. but the clarity, structure and growing mineral vein as the wine opened in the glass had me thinking Chablis\u2026 and so i decided on Chablis, possibly 1er Cru, from a somewhat recent warm vintage (2020/22), and high-quality producer. this, unfortunately, would rule out France for the other wines. the reveal was extremely surprising\u2026 so much so i had to look up the wine's technical details].\n\n13.3% AbV; the fruit comes from shale- and sandstone-rich soils in Carneros, picked on seven different passes, with each lot handled separately but similarly; after whole-cluster press and short skin contact, the clarified juice was racked to new French oak barrels for the initial five or so days of alcoholic fermentation, then racked again to a stainless-lined concrete tank for the completion of fermentation; the fermented wine was then left to complete malo and mature on its lees with no batonnage until the following summer.",

Slightly reductive at the start but this blew off in the glass, revealing a lovely red-fruited nose that was quite sweet on the palate. Natural, but very cleanly made and the acidity was present but very under control here. Good concentration for a Bourgogne Rouge and would definitely have guessed good village at the very least if served blind. Probably will benefit from a few years of ageing at least, but definitely forward-drinking stylistically and can be enjoyed young with some air.

Hints of cola on the nose too after some air, which mellowed out to express cedar wood, tea leaves and spice. Very clean and lovely length on the finish. This bottle was pretty much exactly what I was expecting, and also served as a great contrast against the JFM Bonnes Mares served next to it.\n\nIdeally, I'd forget about these for another 5+ years, and drink younger vintages like the '17 instead which seem to be much more open for business at this point.\n\nLet's ignore the QPR for now, as there are definitely better wines out there at this price.

Very elegant as always, stylistically consistent with JFM's style and drinking beautifully now with some air.\n\nThat being said, having had some examples of his Bonnes Mares now, dare I say though that I prefer his Fuees?

Unfortunately, even according to A who brought the wine, this was somewhat muted and not quite there for Goillotte's lofty standards.\n\nFor myself - I've never been the biggest Roch fan, and am wary of old Rochs as you really have to roll the dice to find one in perfect condition given the lack of sulphur and occasional volatile acidity. With this in mind, I was actually pleasantly surprised at the condition (maybe late release helped?) but that being said it was definitely muted compared to what Roch can be. I want a red-fruit driven, stemmy aromatic explosion... this was quite restrained on that front and didn't have much to show on the palate either in terms of concentration - it was loose and expressive but fell apart too easily. Perhaps it also didn't help that we had a great bottle of Suchots '15 to compare next to it as well.\n\nPersonally, would recommend drinking these up. Would be happy to try again, but not sure I'd seek out actively. Still, thanks to A for sharing this gem!",

Slow-oxed for 2 hours before serving.\n\nSlightly better than my previous bottle (especially considering no disaster with the cork this time!), and also consistent with my overall experience with the 2015s.\n\nThese are darker on the fruit spectrum in general, and have hints of sesame in them from the oak treatment on the nose, and still quite tightly wound. With this in mind, probably opened too young, as we never really got the beautiful floral notes that I know this wine can show. Of course, everything on the palate was spot-on, but just felt a bit shy and I definitely feel that this has more to show.\n\nI would love to revisit this again in 3+ years to see if everything has loosened up a bit. Patience will be rewarded I'm sure, and I already look forward to the next one. Still, a joy to share with friends!",

Palate: Chalky ripe black currant, dark wine grape skins and some tart plum, polished tannins, dark currant and oak on the finish; an enjoyable young wine that has nice weight and dark fruit, but not a ton of complexity. On day two, the nose adds subtle, sweet toasted oak and vanilla, and the flavors on the palate are more integrated. On day three, the oak shift forward and there are more sweet blackberry notes, but not a lot of further development from day two.",

Wonderful ripe, sweet, opulent cassis fruits with cedar, leather, and maybe a hint of tobacco. Great mid-palate with a rich, velvety finish featuring a good dose of oak but very integrated tannins.\nLuxurious, long finish.\nMy wife dubbed this orgasmic and scored it even higher than I did.\nSeems to be in a nice plateau, but I wouldn't wait too many more years on this fabulous wine.",

Given the amount of domestic ros\u00e9s that I\u2019ve had in the past, I didn\u2019t have any high expectations for this one (full disclosure: I\u2019m a fan of the Proven\u00e7al style). However, this one completely surprised me. The nose is filled with juicy berries and fruits (think raspberries, strawberries, plums, etc.) with some minerality and a little salinity. On the palate, there\u2019s a rounded mouthfeel with the integrated acidity lifting the fruits. Perhaps the most impressive aspect of this ros\u00e9 is its super lengthy finish, leaving all those yummy flavor profiles on the palate for at least a minute. Give this ros\u00e9 a quick decant prior to serving. Note: Paired great with chicken and asparagus pizza.",

The nose is great but the palate is a bit thin and tart by comparison. Fill level was almost to the shoulder, which could explain why this wine wasn't as robust as the one I had just over a year ago. On day two, the acid mellows and a beautiful candied cherry makes itself known followed by a faint gritty oak bitterness on the finish; the nose picks up loads of dried oregano and thyme.

In need of severally years to show what I suspect will emerge from its rather blocky, unformed early shell.

I really liked the previous bottles we tried, and that holds true here. Fairly dark in the glass with evidence of bricking and tons of dark fruit (black cherry, blackberry, black raspberry), touches of earth, and just a hint of spice. Yowza. The palate is gorgeous but not as brooding as the nose did portend with bright cherry fruit, spice, that touch of earth, and a brilliant tang. It appears as though I have 4 or 5 bottles of this left and I should get to them sooner rather than later. Remind me? Outstanding. 93 Points.\n\nwww.thedrunkencyclist.com",

The basic criteria was WA rating >90 and price <$20. This one was RP 95 and $17.99.\n\nSerious wine that demands your attention. Deep, nearly opaque garnet. Alluring nose of jammy blackberry, peppercorns, and some herbaceousness (sliced bell pepper, sage, thyme). The fruit density is immediately apparent on the palate. Finishes with a dusting of white pepper and fine but grippy tannins. Tasted blind, I might've guessed a C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie. 13% alcohol.\n\nThis isn't what I was looking for in my Daily Drinker quest. Rather, this is a wine to lay down for a few years. Amazing QPR here. I'm reminded of the 2019 Raul P\u00e9rez Bierzo Ultreia St. Jacques--another value wine which was tightly wound on release and needed a few years to hit its stride.

Fairly aromatic - red berries and rose petals with a touch of spice. On Pnp, this was accessible - juicy with generous fruit but with air this just kept getting harder and leaner and tannic.

This reminds me of the Rothschild VIGNO Carignan I just had with definite integrated sweet oak spice notes on the nose. 14 months in used barrels. However, there\u2019s more structure on the palate. There\u2019s more acidity and tannins although the tannins relatively soft. It\u2019s more powerful and thicker overall with red fruit and licorice. With the hot weather here, it was served too warm, but it just held the 14.5% alcohol heat in to keep it warm but not hot. Overall, more intense and acidic with more aging potential but at the same time it\u2019s a bit more rustic, learning towards classic Chianti.\n\nhttps://winediplomats.com/",

    "Review": "A blend of more robust malt spirit and more neutral grain alcohol that is flavored with juniper and other botanicals. Aged for five years in oak barrels. 38% alcohol.\n\nPale golden yellow color. The nose feels surprisingly subtle with nuanced, slightly sweet-toned aromas of juicy yellow fruits, a little bit of ripe peach, light beeswax tones, a hint of woody spice, a touch of freshly pressed apple juice and a faint floral whiff of botanical spices. The genever feels silky smooth, round and subtly sweet on the palate with nuanced flavors of white peach, some apple jam, light woody notes, a little bit of beeswax and a hint of grapey fruit. The finish is mellow, subtle and slightly warm with a rather long aftertaste of white peach, some apple jam, light floral notes of botanicals, a little bit of beeswax, a hint of savory wood spice and a touch of grapey fruit.\n\nA mellow, accessible and enjoyably nuanced oak-aged genever that feels maybe a bit easy and something of a crowdpleaser, but also very pleasant and sophisticated at the same time. The balance between the subtle sweetness, the faint botanicals, the light woody overtones and the surprisingly fruit-driven overall taste is right on point. If one is expecting a more juniper-driven London Dry Gin kind of genever from this, they might be in for a disappointment, but I found this a pretty tasty effort. Recommended.",

Not too familiar with northern Rh\u00f4ne Syrah, but starting to see why it\u2019s so prized among wine lovers.\n\nA multidimensional wine - fruit forward on the nose, blackberry-dominant with a hint of savory, leafy herb (oregano/sage?). Consistent on the tongue but in the reverse order - savory first, then brambly fruit (blackberry and plum), with a mineral-driven long finish. With air, the fruit and savory characters become better integrated for a very interesting experience. Tannins are integrated enough to be bearable, even enjoyable, but but not quite supple, and with a good amount of acidity present through the finish.\n\nWish I had Coravin\u2019d rather than popping the cork as this was my only bottle.

    "Review": "My first of this one in a few years as I've been mostly focused on my favs of their other single vineyards.\n\nPnp'd right before dinner. Enjoyed about 2/3rds of the bottle over 1-2 hours with a grilled waygu hamburger and a braut. Good pairing.\n\nAt the outset this one was jammy and sweet and lacked more Zin spice that I was looking for. Make no mistake the fruit was good but the wine was all fruit which made it come across as some cheaper Sonoma manufactured Zin. An 88-89 at best. About an hour's worth of air and time to warm to room temp, this changed. The nose developed a little spice component, the jammy fruit backed off and deeper layered blacker fruit appeared with a great acidic backbone and a very long ending. Maybe verging on a 93 but I just can't shake the jammyness at the outset. I'm giving this one a 91 overall. While it's very good fruit, it is not my fav, lacking some of the character elements of other Turleys (unless you consider jammy fruit a 'character'?) One more that I'll save for a year or two before I render judgement on further purchases of this one......",

    "Review": "Just my second trebbiano spoletino, the first being the 2017 Tabarrini Adarmando about 4 years ago. This one has some similarities and some differences. Fijoa is made from a new guyot-trained planting, taken from cuttings of their pre-phylloxera vines trained up trees in the ancient manner. 18-24h cold maceration on the skins, fermentation and aging on lees in stainless, then 7 months in 500L barrels.\nDeep golden, almost amber color is similar to Adarmando. While the color suggested it might be heavy and extracted, it was not. Just 12.5% abv. Smells of acacia and slightly of glue, tastes of just-ripe peach with a mild hint of bitterness. Not high in acidity, but there is enough to make it refreshing - more so than Adarmando, which was quite dense and a little fatiguing. This was nice; glad this variety was saved from extinction. It's truly unique.",

    "Review": "Appearance: slightly hazy though I think that is a filtering choice rather than a flaw. Medium ruby with broad, cherry edges still showing some youthfulness. Legs are plentiful and speedy, indicating a lower level of alcohol.\n\nNose: clean, light that upon opening, was full of ripe, candied cherries and raspberries, and along with the cherry cobbler notes, left no doubt to the carbonic maceration treatment. A full day after opening (vacuum sealed in the refrigerator), however, heavier flavors of green bell pepper, violets, moist earth and sage take over pushing the primary scents to the margins. A salt air component is now also noticeable speaking to its island heritage.\n\nPalate: dry, acidity barely squeaks into the medium(-) range and the tannins are also medium(-) but well-rounded and enjoyable. Alcohol, while, technically medium (12.5%), is so well integrated as to not be noticeable. The body is also medium(-) and the flavor intensity comes in at, yep you guessed it, medium(-) based on strong red fruit flavors of cranberry and pomegranate, damp leaves, and smoke. Like the nose this wine on the palate is a chameleon, changing from Day 1 (candy and fruity) to Day 2 (earthy and savory). The finish is medium(+) as the fruit remains vibrant nicely past the sip.\n\nConclusions: Quality Level: Very good given the intriguing and change flavor intensities and fruity finish. Level of Readiness: can drink wow, but has potential for aging for 3-5 years.\n\nGeneral Notes: I don\u2019t have much experience with wines from the Canary Isles, or the Listan Negro grape, but I can see a place in the cellar for them. With a lighter body and spikey flavors, especially when first opened, this wine makes a great option for reds that benefit from a slight chill. Pair with medium weight grilled meats (game, lamb, game) and vegetables well spiced with Mediterranean spices.",

The wine also shows minerality (limestone and traces of chalk) all nicely integrated with the fruit. Acids were mellow, but there to give the wine some lift, but rounded enough to not stick out. Totally different than the Fevre GC Chablis, but equally as gorgeous (I actually enjoyed this wine more, and I love a great Chablis).

Honeysuckle, sea salt and lemon on the nose with faint roasted cashews. Beautifully energetic on the palate with some powdered lemon bar, white peach, salted popcorn kernel with a little bit of vanilla and toast coming through kudos to the gentle barrel use.

    "Review": "Appearance: clear, deep ruby with ripe cherry edges broadcasting those three years in this wine is still quite youthful. The legs are thick and slow warning of a material alcohol level. The is liquid ruby in a glass.\n\nNose: clean with pronounced chocolate, red plum, red cherry proudly announcing their status as the kings of the pecking order. The princes compete aggressively with notes of violets, eucalyptus, cedar, blackberry, white pepper anise, black licorice and a natural root beer. The nose is potent (medium+), bringing elements from primary, secondary and tertiary stages. Take your time and let them envelop you.\n\nPalate: dry with a surprisingly low (medium-) acidity level but tannins are to-the-moon high. Despite the tannins, there is still a trace of alcohol (14% medium). Body is full of fruit and tannin but the tannins quickly override creating a gritty gauntlet that takes dedication to push through. Outside the Tannin Tsunami, the flavor intensity washes up at a medium+ driven by very ripe blackberry and red cherry. Other noticeable flavors align towards cedar and violets. The flavors can only remain in the finish fight against the Tannin Monster for a couple of seconds (medium-).\n\nConclusions: Quality Level: Good, but we must acknowledge the tannin levels demand certain accommodations. Ours was a slow-smoked pork tenderloin whose partially fatty, smokey, brown and red spice flavors paired very well with the structure of this wine. Level of Readiness: Too Young / Can Drink Now, but has potential for aging.",

This years feels a little heavy handed to me - not sure if I'm expressing that sentiment properly. It's still a really nice wine, so don't get me wrong. But it's more jammy and almost has some syrup like fruit notes in it. My friends liked it a bit more than me. Not sure if this will be better with a little age on it or if it's just a young drinker. Wouldn't hesitate to drink now but a little different in style then what I normally like and then what we normally get from TRB. 2022 Cab!!!",

The palate was pretty amazing! Rich golden fruit, tropical notes, pear, melon and some baked apple. Couple the amazing fruit with streaks of minerality, and you have this wine! This would be a wine that would justified in saying California fruit done in a Burgundian style! Solid 95 for me!\n\nI would rate this wine just below Marcassin and Aubert, and at least on par with Kistler (and I may even like it a touch better!)",

Faded ruby with bricking but that\u2019s the only sign that this had age. Aromatics sported sweet cherry tobacco, older floral/potpurri, and a mix of red and black berry fruits. Juicy and vibrant on the palate! Shocked. Core of red and black fruits carry the profile with fig, herbs and a little bit of leather. Good spine of acidity here.

First approach, nose gave away very little. After maybe an hour, it did indeed develop some interesting and well structured aromas of tobacco, forest, and dark cherry. Tannins still present. Promising! Alas, the wine really fell anpart after about three hours total, with very little complexity on the palate and an increasingly acidic overtone. The nose was gone again too.

Nice florals and red fruit on the nose, with some old leather, woodsy notes, some tar and some spice (allspice, coriander, and hints of nutmeg). Palate was nicely integrated with red and black fruit, mushroom, forest floor, some graphite notes and some tree bark, finishing with some cocoa and sweet oak notes. Everything in nice balance with fruit slightly more prominent. tannins. were well rounded, but not as integrated as I would have preferred. IMO, and for my palate, this wine is just entering its prime drinking window. I love fruit in my wine, and I am not the slightest bit worried it will fade during the next decade. Personally, I will hold off on another bottle because I think the tannins will become even more integrated and get a more velvety texture that will elevate this wine to the next level for my palate.

Tarragon, dried tobacco leaf, graphite, and a hint or leather gravel, and oak round out the flavor profile, although I would say this is more primary fruit driven than not. There is also a nice hint of minerality. Medium-full bodied but very well lifted. No heat despite 14.5% abv. Medium-long, grippy finish. Good acid, would do well with food.\n\nHard to tell how much there is lurking beneath the surface and what 8-10 years cellaring would bring out, but it would probably be helpful.

The tannins are certainly present but not overbearing, actually a little bit soft despite the young age. With proper decanting time, this wine can certainly be opened now.\n\nThis is a new wine/producer in Stags Leap District with Aaron Pott conducting the winemaking. If you have had an Aaron Pott wine before, you can certainly taste it here. This wine is already excellent in the challenging 2022 vintage, and I am very excited to see how it evolves in future vintages and years. I am already fan now (95-97).",

The palate, however, feels much fresher. It's lead by flavors of leather, dried porcini mushrooms and dust before transitioning to orange peel, ripe red currants, ripe strawberries and fresh tarragon. The condition of the fruits is fresher than 29 years of age would suggest, though it finishes with a hint of fig jam that betrays its true age. Medium + intensity of flavors.\n\nStructurally nice as well, at 29. Medium + body with medium + acid and soft medium tannins. This reminds me of an older man with a lot of plastic surgery who appears younger than he is; but whose true age is apparent upon a closer examination. While it's clearly getting tertiary, it's not dying yet! Drink now. Just don't look too closely, or things will get awkward.",

Restrained elements of baking spices and light wood char are sprinkled atop. A well-structured palate with firm, chalky tannins provides backbone. The fruit, meanwhile, is rather subdued, but there is a pleasant mouth-cleansing acidity. Slowly, some sweet fruit of black fruit, cola tonic, morelly cherry and vanilla custard emerge. Fairly compact mid-palate, the wine gains a spicy angle whilst the tannins start to rise towards a more grainy, almost abrasive edge. However, the wine has balance with its juicier core and lingers nicely on the finish. A little tight at present, it promises more and is a superb example!",

Medium bodied (13.5% ABV) with white apple and soft (as opposed to bright/tart) pear as the primary fruit notes. Fruit shows good expression, but with restraint so it isn't over the top. Backside is where this wine really takes off as the tart notes, acidity, touch of oak and earth notes all comes together with the fruit. The result is impressive balance whereby the depth of the mid-body seems amplified and the nuances of the fruit come into focus. This balance of fruit and structure shows the strengths of both to their best advantage. Showing quite well now and has a number of years ahead of it at this high level.

Nach kurzer Bel\u00fcftung im Glas sind auch Noten kandierter Ananas, Feuersteins sowie Vanille wahrnehmbar. Breit, cremig, sauber strukturiert, zartbitter sowie leicht prickelnd auf der Zunge mit eher gehaltvollem K\u00f6rper und deutlich mineralischer Basis, gefolgt von anschwellendem Ausklang, appetitanregend und zugleich w\u00fcrzig, mit langem, leicht haftendem Nachhall. Um das volle Potenzial des Weines zu ergr\u00fcnden empfiehlt sich ein Chardonnay Glas sowie leicht k\u00fchle 12-14\u00b0C.\n\nAromatik und Struktur machen diesen Wein zum idealen Essensbegleiter: mit Frischk\u00e4se gef\u00fcllte Auberginenrollen, gratinierte Gem\u00fcse, orientalischer Couscous Salat, Libanesische K\u00fcche oder w\u00fcrzige Speisen aus Fernost.\n\nUrsula Irion l\u00e4sst die beiden PiWi Sorten getrennt im Barrique durch Umgebungshefen spontan verg\u00e4ren. Anschliessend reifen die Jungweine auf der Feinhefe, wobei der Satz regelm\u00e4ssig aufger\u00fchrt wird.

Also, aromatically I was looking for something more - perhaps more sesame and popcorn, accentuated with gunpowder - that you get from the best whites around.\n\nOverall, a huge wine and a very good one, but perhaps not the best Chevalier according to Leflaive's own lofty standards.

One of the pioneers in this region for incredible blends of some of Italies most revered and ancient grapes. 70% Sangiovese and 30% Canaiolo. Wine at this level is such an incredible sensory experience.\n\nOnes that have the propensity for long time aging potential tell a different story each year as they start to stack up over time. Very little color degradation or bricking near the rim and the quality and integrity of this cork was the first indicator that this was stored in the best conditions. It was a vintage close out direct from the winery and has been cellared there since bottling.\n\nThe tannin and acid are well integrated at this point but they sure are making their presence felt. The wine is just busting with elegance and finesse. An absolute aromatic bomb of dried and crushed roses, a brush of violet, raisined cranberries, strawberry jam, orange marmalade, and medijool dates.",

P&P and slowly enjoyed.\n\nA pleasant surprise: whole cluster aromatics, quite sweet and red-fruit driven, almost reminiscent of Bizot stylistically even if not quite there in terms of intensity and concentration. Cleanly made and acidity well controlled, though this didn't have much in terms of palate or finish. Would be happy to try again, and am curious to track the progression of this producer. Would probably describe this as a crowd-pleaser, but not the most intellectual wine - which is perfectly fine, for the right occasion! Drinkable now but will probably improve with a little bit of bottle age - I'd recommend revisiting in 2+ years.",

    "Review": "I was originally intended to keep this in remote storage for a little longer, but then I thought it might be interesting to try it now, especially in view of the fact that I bought a bit more quality cinsault, of higher price, from another producer to drink later.\n\nPreviously when I have enjoyed SA cinsaults - which it took me a little while to get used to, and then I decided I really liked thme - they have been pale almost on the edge of ros\u00e9. A follow-on vintage of one of those enjoyed wines which was rather darker and heavier came over as clumsy and cheap. So I was kind of a bit worried when this one came out dark, unlike the pale ones I liked.\n\nBut this is in a different class from the one I didn't like. There was a bit of bubblegum I didn't like on day 1, but then I had that same experience, indeed much more, with the others that I liked, at least when they were younger or hadn't had a enough air yet.\n\nThis one does have a lot of intensity of cherry, as everyone says. I'm not sure I'm yet quite such an enthusiast as higher marks given, and it did vary by the 4 days I drank it over (really nice on days 2 &3, tired on day 4).\n\nAt the moment not a wine to put in front of guests to wow them, a bit too wacky for that. But certainly a very interesting package I'm looking forward to tracking over the next few years.",

Between light and medium bodied (14% ABV) with pear and white melon upfront and through the middle, adding some lemon notes behind. Good mix of minerals and moderate acidity on the back combined with citrus notes provide strength and finishing length. Initially nice, but as it opens up (in line with how the nose evolved), gains noticeable depth as well as complexity. By the end, showed better complexity than I have experienced with this varietal previously. Score is roughly indicative how it's showing today, but I think with another year or an hour or so open it will really show that depth and nuance. I'd be excited to try this wine again.

The 2016 \u201cSan Valentino\u201d pours a deep garnet color with a near opaque core; medium+ viscosity with moderate staining of the tears. On the nose, the wine is developing with notes of ripe black and red fruits: black berries, black plum, Morello cherry, spiced meat, old wood, varnish, cumin and dry earth. On the palate, the wine is dry with medium+ tannin and medium+ acid. Confirming the notes from the nose. The finish is long, tangy and slightly savory. These are showing very well at this stage and I don\u2019t expect that to change for many years to come. Drink now with patience (perhaps even a 30min decant) and through 2036.",

The palate is majestic with a rich mouthfeel, plenty of weight, juicy fruit, even a decade out. But the tartness is the story here.

That seemed like a good decanting scheme as it had lost none of it's intensity, yet had filled out on the savoury notes and dialed back on the primary fruit, which was at the fore upon opening.\nA more proper tasting note: Super rich and voluptuous with ripe, dark fruits, Roast'n'toast from both Syrah character and oak, espresso, chocolate, olive tapenade, pine smoke and pink peppercorns. Warps the scale for intensity. In the mouth it is equally concentrated and intense, yet glides over your palate effortlessly and you long for the next sip immediately. So fulfilling and satisfying. Again, SQN takes it 10% further than what others achieve. Take your pick between 97-100 points. If you're looking for red fruited, cool elegance, stay away. I guess I had gladly taken it even more savoury, so perhaps even longer decant or the obvious further cellaring would improve it even further, so I'll go with 98.",

Similarly invigorating in the mouth with magnificent strawberry flavours and a good deal of depth; some liquorice in the finish. This wine carries its hefty alcoholic charge lightly, meaning that it has enough stuffing to distract from the alcohol.

Some dry notes add to the aromatic complexity as well. Medium bodied (16% ABV) with red cherry upfront, supported by darker red cherry and black cherry through the middle. The overall expression this wine already shows through the middle is quite impressive. Good structural qualities to the back with tannins and acidity in keeping with the fruit. Right now, the strengths of this wine are its expression and its balance, but it also feels like there more complexity to be revealed in time as this wine both continues to open up as well as generally integrate. For the price, this represents high QPR, is very drinkable now but retains significant positive evolutionary potential. (Bin 152 Wine Bar; Charleston, South Carolina).",

    "Review": "A korenwijn, ie. not technically a genever, since the style might not include any juniper - a required flavoring in genevers - at all. However, as Bols advertises this spirit as a genever, I imagine it contains some juniper. The base contains at least 51% of malt wine, ie. distilled malt spirit, blended together with some grain spirit. Aged for at least two years in an oak barrel. Bottle #205020. 38% alcohol.\n\nPale lemony yellow color. The nose feels very sweet and very noticeably fruity with pronounced aromas of grapey fruit, some greengage, light leafy herbal notes, a little bit of pear, a hint of juniper and a spirituous touch of alcohol. The genever feels rich, round and mellow with very somewhat sweet-toned, fruit-driven flavors of ripe grapey fruit, some pear, a little bit of grassy bitterness, light juniper nuances, a leafy hint of herbal greenness and a hint of floral character. The finish is long, fruity and a bit warm with rich flavors of sweet, grapey fruit, some pear, a little bit of grassy bitterness, light peppery nuances and a faint hint of juniper.\n\nThis was something of an odd bird. We were expecting something like an aged genever, but instead of tasting particularly evolved, this tasted just REALLY fruity. Although the spirit shows a bit more depth and complexity than a neutral jonge genever, the style felt still a bit raw and unintegrated. And a bit too in-your-face with its heady, exuberant fruity qualities. Enjoyable, but I prefer something more fine-tuned.",

The deep blackfruit is quite intense upfront, but gains more openness and expression through the middle. Plenty of tannins, tart black fruits, acidity and dryness on the backside and through the finish. With the depth of fruit and the nuances and complexity it already shows, coupled with the structure which promises more balance in the future, this wine has significant upside potential.

There is just the slightest hint of the barnyard funk I've found in previous vintages, but even that dissapates quite quickly.\n\nPalate is bright, with the classic tart red fruit edge, cranberries, raspberry & redcurrants, there is also some richer black cherry in there. This seems quite clean and glossy compared with '19s, there is a lovely sweetness to the fruit. Very enjoyable, going to struggle to keep my hands off these. Good to go now, but no hurry.",

Bottle #83. 38% alcohol.\n\nLuminous golden yellow color. The nose feels like a Bourbon oak bomb with aromas of caramel, some coconut, a little bit of cedar and a hint of vanilla. No juniper or any other traditional genever aromas whatsoever. The genever feels quite heavy, somewhat sweet-toned and a bit hot on the palate with rich and punchy flavors of vanilla and coconut, some caramel tones, a little bit of toffee, light honeyed nuances, a hint of cedar and a touch of dried pineapple. The mouthfeel is a bit viscous, too. The aftertaste is rich, warm and lengthy with a bold, oak-driven aftertaste of caramel and vanilla, some coconut, a little bit of dried pineapple, light toffee nuances, a hint of cedary oak and a touch of acacia honey.\n\nA huge and rather overdone monster of a distillate that might technically be a Genever, but it drinks like a Bourbon. It's hard to assess, as we tasted the spirit in a genever tasting, but I think it's entirely possible to not notice anything if this spirit was tasted blind in a bourbon tasting. This is all about huge, punchy oak and nothing else. For such a distillate, this is actually quite good and even somewhat enjoyable - even if I'm not the biggest fan of the overall style. Fun stuff if you happen to like oak bombs.",

The color was surprisingly bright and on the palate, it still had lots of life and fine tannins. The taste was not particularly enjoyable, with a light bitterness. The last sips were better. The wine seemed to have found its balance. Interesting experience, as always with old bottles, but enjoyment was limited.",

    "Review": "Next night, I had decanted 325ml into a half bottle. Almost all the sulphur had blown off I think. Now the bouquet shows some extra ripe fruit and the palate contains some brambly ripe stalk material. Overall the flavour is very much where I like it - a heady mix of cherry raspberry perhaps some black doris plum, succulent strawberries maybe some rhubarb and that hint of pomegranate. I reckon without that objectionable sulphur opening and a lick more French Oak this would be awesome. If you can double decant and wait for the sulphur to blow off you have a rather impressive ripe fruited medium bodied slightly savoury Pinot to enjoy with duck, salmon, chicken etc. Nice.",

    "Review": "Domaine Jamet C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie 2019 (97 p)\n100% Syrah\n\nLocated in the heart of C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie, Domaine Jamet is one of the most highly regarded vineyards in the northern Rh\u00f4ne. The vineyards (approx. 7 ha) are located on steep, sun-exposed slopes with mineral-rich, granitic soils, which contribute to the structure of the wines. The main grape is Syrah and Jamet is known for creating elegant, powerful and age-worthy C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie wines that capture the essence of this grape.\n\nThe grapes are hand-harvested from old vines, only the best grapes are used. Whole bunches are used for fermentation, fermentation takes place in open vats, which allows for gentle extraction. The must is given about three weeks of maceration. Storage takes place in a balanced mixture of new (15%) and older barrels - where it is allowed to mature for about 22 months.\n\nAs with all higher quality wines, there is a complexity that contributes to the wine by just growing and growing during an evening like this. From first thinking that the wine is far too young, to become the wine of the evening. This shows how good the Syrah grape can be with the right terroir, location and winemaking. After 3 \u2013 4 hours I realize that this is a new experience for me, I have never experienced the Syrah grape in this way. Blackberries, plums, black and white pepper, tapenade (black olives) charcuterie and meatiness. Clear tannins that are velvety smooth, a fairly high acidity that indicates how good this will be in 10 \u2013 15 years, wow! Wait 3 \u2013 5 more years, can be stored for 20 \u2013 30 more years\u2026at least!",

What makes Thistledown a little special is that they work with selected vineyards in some of South Australia's most prestigious wine regions. McLaren Vale: for its old Grenache vines, where Thistledown produces several of its most acclaimed wines. Barossa Valley: more powerful and complex wines for Shiraz and Grenache. Adelaide Hills: a cooler climate area that contributes to elegant and fresh Chardonnay wines. The focus is on three main grapes: Grenache, Shiraz and Chardonnay.\n\nThe grapes were handpicked from old vines in the Clarendon area of McLaren Vale. 20% whole bunches and the remainder destemmed grapes. The fermentation was with natural yeasts, and the must was stirred twice daily during the active fermentation phase. After fermentation, the wine is pressed into 300-liter French oak barrels, 25% of which were new, for a twelve-month aging.\n\nThis produces a wonderful fruit where the strength of the Grenache is the texture that gives a mouthfeel similar to Pinot Noir, but with a clearer tannin structure. Ripe strawberries, raspberries and red currants. There are clear tobacco and licorice notes, also violets and a lovely herbaceousness that creates a harmonious feeling. Drink now or age for another 5 \u2013 10 years.",

The vineyards are divided into two areas: Pelagrilli in northern Montalcino with clayey soils, and Piancornello in southern Montalcino with a warmer climate and sandier soils. The estate focuses exclusively on Sangiovese, the grape behind Brunello di Montalcino, and combines traditional viticulture with modern winemaking.\n\nThe grapes are hand-harvested from over 35-year-old Sangiovese vines. After careful selection, the must ferments in steel tanks at a controlled temperature. The wine is then aged for 24 months in 225-liter French oak barrels before bottling. The production of this wine amounts to approximately 25,000 bottles/year.\n\nThis was the second best wine of the evening, quite simply in my book. Full harmony, elegant and powerful at the same time. Thanks to its 15 years, everything has merged into a homogeneous wine, still super clear fine-grained tannins with fruit that shines. The beginning of tertiary notes (Forrest floor) elevates the wine to another level. Lucky to have two bottles left of this wonderful vintage. Still, it got beaten by Domanie Jamet this evening\ud83d\ude0a. Drink now or store for another 5 \u2013 10 years.",

The grapes are normally allowed to macerate for 25 days with \"pump-over\" three times a day. The wine is then aged for 3 years in botti of French and Slavonian oak.\n\nThis was one of the better Barolo from 2020 in my opinion, elegant, well-balanced between fruit and structure.

    "Review": "Bit of a paradox. Color and aromas seem older than 2009. Blind guess would have been that this must have some reserve wine in it. And yet...the wine gets better with time open and starts to gain focus and delineation - later glasses are superior to the first glass. At this stage the wine is very good, but it never hits true excellence on this night. Might hold a bottle for a few more years to see what happens.",

There is some fruit (red and blue berries, hint of cherry, blood orange) but it's not very prominent. It's a little unbalanced and there's a hint of shoe shine that I don't find very pleasant. On the second and third nights it's more integrated, the fruit comes out much better, the shoe shine is gone, some truffle and other aging notes are starting to appear. It's not a super complex wine but a fine example of red burgundy. If you still have one, this could do with a bit of further aging but it's drinking very well right now.",

    "Review": "Haven't written any notes here in a while but this bottle brought me right back here.\n\nTasted alongside a bunch of whites/oranges from Carso and Oslavia, because I guess that's a totally normal thing to do on a Tuesday night.\n\nTo me, this stood head and shoulders above the rest.\n\nThere aren't too many wineries across the two regions and a part of me really wanted an underdog or otherwise undiscovered producer to win, but there's a good reason why Gravner is one of the most acclaimed in the region.\n\nWhat stood out to me here was a distinct salted caramel impression - i've only really encountered this in an orange wine once (which i'll get into later), otherwise i've really only gotten honeyed, mandarin, and tea characters from them.\n\nThe only wine from Gravner i'd tasted before this was the 2014 Ribolla, and while I get there's 7 years in between them, the Ribolla had none of this specific salted caramel character.\n\nAfter doing a bit of digging, I think I found my answer - noble rot.\n\nWhile i've only found references to there being noble rot in 2008 and 2009, the 14.5% ABV here points towards a higher must weight and so I think it's safe to conclude there was some noble rot at play here too.\n\nThe wine was otherwise clean. Structurally, the tannins here felt fully resolved, and there's a distinct 'fatness' to the mouthfeel, like a toned-down Sauternes.\n\nOn to that one other wine i've encountered this character in: Mongaku Valley Winery's Kifuhinoki, made from botrytised Pinot Noir and Pinotage. (of course it was a Japanese wine)\n\nThe key difference here is the acidity - with Gravner's wine, the acidity is expectedly low but not quite into flabby territory. Mongakudani's wine unfortunately struggles in this aspect, I suspect because of how acidity falls off with those varietals as opposed to Gravner's SB, PG, and Riesling. In this regard, I think for this style of wine, it matters a lot what varietals are used.\n\nSo where does this leave us?\n\nFor one, this wine isn't being made anymore which sucks, but I think Gravner's Ribolla has the potential to achieve the same greatness. It's a high acidity grape with tight bunches that can be prone to botrytis, so I imagine such characters might vary vintage to vintage.\n\nUnfortunately, there aren't any vintage reports for Oslavia that I could find. Why is that?\n\nIt's 2025. Let's bring something new to the table this year.",

Drinking well now and will probably show its best in 4 or 5 years. Remarkably different in style from the old school Trapet I had from the 90s and early 00s, which took about 20 to 30 years to show its best.

The nose isn\u2019t as spicy and just slightly less intense, but still very inviting and lovely. The palate has many of the same delicious elements though it is not as deep and complex. Not quite as much stamina through the finish. 5+12+16+8= 91",

The nose is reticent and principally sous-bois at this point, though there remains a touch of austere elegance that reminds one that this is Volnay and that it is Champans. The attack is gentle, following with just a touch of lingering roundness in the mid-palate that is really a ghost (again, not surprising for an 18-year old Volnay) of what it once was. It is very 2007 in that it is light (even now) and elegant. The palate still retains some precision with dusty and oxidizing fruit that are brought together by a healthy dose of acidity. Any tannins there may have been have completely melted away but this also means that this is now relying entirely on acidity to hold it together and that acidity is starting to tire considerably. This is a wine you are tasting for what it once was not for what it is. Pleasant and adequate as a food wine but any bottles remaining need to have been consumed yesterday.",

Bought on release stored at 57*\nTasted over 3 days.\nDay 1: SLO OX in bottle for 4 hours: unappealing green, woody tannins, dry, unripened red fruit? I expected this bc of the 2017 weather variables impact on vintage.\nDay 2: Slow Ox in bottle 8 hours. End result: no elegance or dark and brooding fruit- mostly green bell pepper; maybe a point better; similar as day 1. Was hoping I'd get some Tokalon cassis and perfume to come through.\nDay 3: Slow Ox for 7 hours then a splash decant. While the tannins softened a bit, the fruit remained closed for business. Concentrated and dense, yet lacking the lushness of ripe aromatic fruit. Just another lame $250 wine...a solid 90.\n\nSadly, I missed the Schrader 16 offer window by a week after being on their allocation list since 2008. I begged but was shut out. In concession I was added to the mailing list for the 2017 vintage. Knowing the growing and vinifying challenges for 2017 I asked if I could pass on 2017 allo and restart in 2018. NO! So this was essentially a hostage purchase. Am I still a customer? Yep, I'm like a perfectly trained dog now. Had to hang in for the 23s and 24s. In the meantime, the next time I open a 2017 Schrader will be in 5 years if I don't unload them first!",

I looked through a lot of reviews online and found that the \u201823 Diatom Chardonnay was well liked and had many excellent reviews. Also, at K&L it is $21.99, so I thought I would give it a try and bought a six pack. I was pleasantly surprised when we opened up a bottle tonight with my wife\u2019s wonderful chicken/tortilla casserole. The wine is really excellent. I can comfortable rate it 91-92. Just the right amount of acidity to make it interesting, lots of citrus (I tasted lemon, grapefruit(, a hint of pear an apples, no oak, and very smooth. It has a good finish and should easily last another 2-4 years. It\u2019s not Aubert, but at 1/4 the price, it is a bargain. Give it a try and you will not be disappointed.",

Also shows strawberry jam (Grenache), maybe a little earthy topsoil and a hint of licorice. Super-juicy palate, balanced by some light acidity. Gentle tannins prevent it from being flabby. Alcohol at 15.2% is very well integrated.\n\nThis goes down way too easily. Strong QPR at $17. My 92 rating not too far off of RP 93.

    "Review": "First experience with Schueller's Pinots. The nose is fantastic! Layers of fruit, flowers, a hint of baking spices, blood orange, pine needles, and tart berries. The palate, on the other hand, is predominantly tart and acidic. Once you get past that tartness, there are strawberries, pomegranate, tart cherries, and earthy notes. Good finish. I'm not really sure what to think about this. I absolutely loved the nose (and would probably rate it 94-95) but the palate is too much of a contrast and doesn't have the depth (probably a 88-89).",

    "Review": "For such a well-presented bottle, we were quite disappointed by this sake. The nose is extremely yeast-heavy, almost like freshly-risen bread. We tried this sake at room temperature, over ice (as mentioned in the enclosed pamphlet), and heated to ~40C. The room temperature sake had a musky flavour, a bit too acidic for my taste. Chilled on ice was the most palatable, as the melting ice helped mellow out the harsher notes. Warm was better than room temperature, with much more of the sweetness coming through but still with some of the strange yeasty notes. This sake was certainly an experience, but not one that I would say a sake connoisseur is required to have.",

Le nez, sensible \u00e0 l\u2019a\u00e9ration et aux changements de temp\u00e9rature \u00e9volue beaucoup dans le verre. On y d\u00e9tecte des ar\u00f4mes de cerise rouge \u00e0 la cannelle, typique selon moi des Givry, mais aussi des fruits plus noirs, cerise, m\u00fbre ou prune. On y ajoute une trame tertiaire de sous-bois d\u2019automne, de champignons. Le bois\u00e9 est subtil et tout \u00e0 fait int\u00e9gr\u00e9. La bouche a un corps l\u00e9ger, la structure tr\u00e8s souple, a\u00e9rienne, les tannins fins, poudreux enti\u00e8rement fondus. L\u2019acidit\u00e9 assez \u00e9lev\u00e9e lui donne une belle fraicheur. C\u2019est bon frais et l\u00e9ger, mais mon impression aujourd\u2019hui est que ce vin a d\u00fb \u00eatre plus \u00e9clatant en jeunesse, le fruit devait \u00eatre tr\u00e8s all\u00e9chant.

The fruit qualities start off as dry on the nose at first but get more and more juicy the longer the wine is open. Medium bodied with plenty of balance as well as expressive and pretty fruit upfront that gives it a more Burgundian feel as opposed to the much deeper, darker, more muscular presentation this grape often shows. It's mixed blackfruit with balance and depth through the middle supported by structure consisting of tannins, acidity and tart black fruit qualities. The structure is still concealing a touch of the complexity towards the back, telling me this wine should continue to evolve positively in the near term. Varietally correct, but on a prettier and more accessible frame than this grape can sometimes show. (Bin 152 Wine Bar; Charleston, South Carolina).",

The palate is tart, high spikey acidity and medium+ powdery tannins melt gradually in downward linear curve, and what\u2019s left is moderately warm/silky mouthfeel with bittersweet leafiness like an expensive oolong tea. Overall, a little lean/somber but precise/focused. I can see this to improve in the next several years. 89 for now, but potentially 90.\n\nDay 2 - gained suppleness of lingonberry, just as expected. The texture is still powdery and detailed. 89-90.\n\nPer producer\u2019s website, \u201c The soil in Barolo, close to the Cannubi sub-region, is sandy; on the slope overlooking the hill of La Morra, the soil is more compact. The vineyard has a southwestern exposure.\u201d. (I wrote it down because I felt the wine is speaking about its origin).",

    "Review": "October 2022 disgorgement, 100% Pinot Noir, no dose, farmed bio. This is the treatment for all the wines from the domaine, with just variances on the plot sources or varietal composition. I have had a lot of bottles from R-L, so to see this sitting on my BBQ island as we cleaned up from the party, I thought, well, that's good fortune so let's seal up the remainder and try tomorrow. I left this on the counter for today, serving without chill at 66f room temp. Pairing with cheese, crackers and blueberries. Rose gold color, as mentioned by another person in their notes. This is pretty true to the R-L style--crisp, baked apple, gentle mineral and subtle crushed red fruits. This vintage of Papillon has a cool chisel to it, along with something I would describe as both juicy and lightly plump, too. As to the acid, it's here yet well-placed in the wine, it's an orangey citrus. Nicely composed finish, very neat and balanced. I like this iteration of Papillon but I'm more convinced that the addition of equal parts Chardonnay and Pinot Noir from the Fosse-Grely plot that goes into the cuvee of the same name is the better cuvee from the domaine. I just got my 2020s of Fosse-Grely so will have that one teed top over the next few weeks (of note, the 2019 of that cuvee is dy-no-might!--a must try if you are an R-L fan).",

Was looking for a pairing with my \"Dad's Famous Pot Roast\" and roast potatoes - simple but delicious and family fav...:) Decanted for 3+ hours before drinking, saved 1/4 of the bottle for Day 2.\n\nDark ruby, almost no signs of age. Nose of black raspberry, spice, damp earth. Palate of candied red berries, plum, cloves and baking spice. Heavier and more viscous than most Pinot. Tart red fruits, rhubarb and cranberry on the mid palate. Full body, long finish.\n\nAubert Pinot is unique, in my experience, in its need for prep. Specifically, the winery recommends standing up the bottle a day in advance. This wine shows best with a 3-4 hour decant, which is what I did here. When first opened its very tight, a bit astringent. Its a completely different profile after the extended decant. I would speculate that some of the tasters that note the wine over the hill may have done a Pop and Pour - this bottle still has another decade in it.\n\nAs noted, patience and prep is a must to properly enjoy this wine.\n\nPS Day 2 - good but not necessarily better. Some prior bottles needed a full day!\n\nmy experience with Aubert Pinot",

Extraordinarily complex on the palate with flavors of garrigue, caraway, dust, ash, black pepper leading the way. Mid palate, it transitions to braised beef, chalk and the fruit (ripe dark plums and ripe raspberries). Fruit backward, though the fruit is still there. Finishes spicy and minty. High intensity of flavors. Texturally plush and velvety despite its obvious heft.\n\nFull bodied with medium acid and grippy medium + tannins. Drink now with air, or hold for 3-5 more years for an even more fruit-backward experience. 15% and I don't mind it (Rayas and Montisci are the only two producers who can really pull 15% off).

It's very different than any Condrieu I've had.\n\nOrange peel, ripe apricot, toasted hazelnuts and fresh baked bread on the nose. Oxidative and less floral than I'd expect for Viognier, though it has the high intensity. Fruit backward on the palate with flavors of fresh baked bread, wet stone, fermented cabbage, lemon peel and orange peel. Totally mineral driven with plenty of lees flavors to back it up. I don't miss the fruit at all. Medium + intensity of flavors.\n\nMedium + body with the classic (for Viognier) medium - acid. This is a really cool take on Viognier, and completely different from textbook Condrieu. It's in a great place at 10. Drink now!",

    "Review": "Our penultimate bottle, decanted off its sediment (very fine and very little of it) and poured...set aside the glass for twenty minutes while I wrapped up a couple of things. Aromas of fruitcake, dried raspberry, black cherry, plum and holiday spices. Notes of licorice, lavender and white pepper emerge with a bit of swirling, and there's just a subtle hint of earthy/barnyard funk- other bottles have shown a fair amount but this is nicely in the background and not overwhelming. Flavors of red berry fruit- mulberry- and red plum, along with something a touch herbal, hinting at sage. Medium-bodied, with soft tannins and a nice vein of acidity, finishing with fruit and length. The fruit is quite nice and there's nice complexity here. An excellent example of this wine...wish I'd have opened this for one the blind tasting groups as they've seen lesser examples of this. Hopefully our last bottle shows as well.",

The nose has medium intensity aromas of ripe cranberry, red cherry compote, vanilla bean, baking spice, rhubarb pie, and lingonberry preserves. It's quite dense and ripe. The palate is dry with medium (+) acidity, a medium body and medium tannins. The red fruit flavors are quite pronounced, the vanilla and accompanying oak influence is very subtle and well integrated. The tannins melt away beautifully and give this wine a lovely mouthfeel. The finish has a touch of charred oak alongside some ever so slight tart and bitter notes. It's a really nice rendition of Kiwi Pinot- extracted a bit more than Burgundy, not as jammy as a Cali and showing off its own unique terror. Nicely done- 93 points worth for this $100 offering which makes it a 4 star effort in my books. I'm pairing it with roast duck breast, sugar snap peas and some boiled potatoes.

Powerful, muscular with blackcurrant, blackberry, big herbs,big coffee ,cocoa, tobacco ( another big). Very, very long finish with herbs and coffee and some bitter notes.\nComplain? Surprisingly - soft spice, acidity and tannins could be better integrated\nAromas? Lovely\nBlackcurrant, black cherry, tobacco, coffee, mint, herbs and much more.\n\nWine critics didn't like this wine too much. Why?\nThey tasted it when it was three or four years old and they complained that this one is too young to drink.\nMy oh my. If so then state it, but don't score it.\nThey have money and all means to retest much later.\nMatter of fact no \"big\" Bordeaux wines should be given a score at their release. Wine critics play the role of wizards and predict how wine will taste in years to come.\nMatter of fact they also predict something unpredictable like when a wine can approach maturity and how long it can stay drinkable.\nLet's see this wine. We have 2025 as a drinkable limit or...even 2062! Come on !\nBecause of that I won't write critics scores tonight \ud83d\ude04",

The merlot is fleshy and opulent, and the cab provides some structure. Fine, lightly drying tannins on the finish. 14% alcohol.\n\nThis wine is precisely the type I\u2019ve been looking for in my QPR search. I bought a single bottle because of the RP 91 rating and the $11.69 cost\u2014well within my stated parameters. Fruity, a little complexity, and no hard edges.

    "Review": "Stood up for 1 week and decanted off a tiny amount of sediment in the last oz. Light-medium ruby as expected for Ghemme; very high intensity aromatics with strawberry, red fruited, sweet spices, cinnamon and nutmeg; palate is light bodied, youthful red strawberries, tannins present but surprisingly approachable, high refreshing acidity, absolutely impeccable balance; medium-long finish with fruit and spice complexity. A wonderful Ghemme, showing a bit of richness and depth while maintaining the freshness that I love in nebbiolo. Rovellotti is one of my favorite producers that I buy every year, and it's always very good to excellent. However, this 2017 seems to have launched another gear, on par with some of my absolute favorites (like 2013), and perhaps set up to surpass it. The winemaking here is stellar, and honestly vastly better than I can find at double the price in Barolo. 94\nLike all good young Nebbiolo, this tightens up with time in the glass as the fruit becomes less prominent and the tannins show more. This is a serious wine, incredibly enjoyable now but with plenty of growth ahead of it.\nDay 2: Well balanced, less showy, still some prominent tannins, but still very enjoyable. The depth is still here, even if the aromatics are a bit less showy. Honestly, I would be happy if a $150 Barolo showed as well as this wine.",

Double decanted through a tea strainer both ways and still lots of tannin thrown off in the glass. On the palate - crunchy tannins are there at the front and sides of the mouth, but coming down the middle is this joyous, elevated fruit. Is this ready? Not sure, but I certainly am. Puts me in mind of that feeling I get when drinking good Cru Beaujolais, but that often leaves me thinking - i wish this were just a BIT more serious. No such feelings here. This wine, is fun, engaging, grippy, and also serious. It's turning up to your house in an early 2000s convertible BMW, but it also knows exactly where to drive and you know it isn't going to crash or get caught speeding.",

On the palate, the wine is medium(-) bodied, with medium(+) acidity and fine-grained tannins. The flavours reflect the nose. The style is pure, restrained, and elegant. The finish is long. A beautifully made Garnacha, more reminiscent of Pinot Noir or a Rayas-inspired expression than traditional, full-bodied Montsant. Already drinking well, but will gain complexity with 2\u20134 years of bottle age.

Lots of crushed black plums and red cherries , macerating in a wet and rusty iron pot. Exciting hints of roast coffee, earthy spearmint, and saddle leather. Cote Rotie type floral phenolics not yet evident, but will likely show in 5 or 6 years, as this settles down. Acidity and alcohol seem dominant on the long finish, but after the 3 hour decant we happily drank this with a spicy and complex shredded oxtail ragu.

The mid-palate has loganberry and blackberry with a light smattering of spice, biscuit, milk chocolate, fungi and tree bark. While it has structure and presence, it remains slightly unyielding and chalky, lacking the refinement of top-tier Brunellos. It felt commercial, aiming for broad appeal rather than profound complexity. Good, but not great; I wondered whether the year had given plenty of fruit tannins and less oak was needed or whether the fruit had slowly seeped out of the wine given its age (or perhaps it didn't have much to start with?\nA more modern style, it is made from 100% Sangiovese and aged in a mix of French oak barriques and larger Slavonian oak casks for at least 30 months. 1999 was a solid but not exceptional year in Montalcino, producing structured and firm wines that often required extended ageing to soften.",

Bold, lacking a certain grace and finesse, again power over elegance but a little more integrated than the April bottle.\n100% Sangiovese, grown at 310-400m altitude on galestro soils. The younger vineyard was matured in a mix of Slavonian oak casks and smaller French barrels.",

An intense, fragrant bouquet of a complex mix of purple wildflowers, leather, truffle, violets, and balsamic notes. The palate reflects with an elegant, precise line of bright acidity, a grippy chalk-dust texture that leads to fine but dense cocoa powder-like tannins. Some blackberry and cherry fill the mid-palate. Well-structured but on the leaner side, there is a freshness and tremendous depth of flavour as this athletic wine powers towards a protracted finish.\nComplex, refined and somewhat intriguing, with more compact, finer tannins than density. Somewhat better and more integrated than April's bottle.\n100% Sangiovese, sourced from Sant'Angelo in Colle. Matured in large French oak casks for 36 months.",

    "Review": "90% Viura, 10% Malvasia\n\n12.5%\n\nColor: golden yellow\n\nOn the nose: reminds me exactly of spiced apple cider and apple sauce: stewed apples and baking spices. Also get a little hint of peach and dried apricots.\n\nPalate: A rollercoaster of flavours. Upfront predominant apple peel. Thick and oily mouthfeel. Medium body. High acidity. Follows with a citrus gauntlet: lemon, orange, grape fruit, and then to baking spices and roasted hazelnuts. Lots of oak influence but well integrated. Comes back to apple in the finish and closes out with a wave of salinity and minerals, like drinking the ocean. Quite savory and classic oxidative notes. Very long finish, with the salinity staying on your palate for a good 30 seconds+.\n\nIncredible wine, and certainly unique. From the first sip, for a second you think you are drinking a sweet spiced apple cider but it instantly morphs into an incredibly complex dry wine. This 2013 is the most recent release from the winery and it drinks beautifully. Recently I drank a 2016 Gravonia and the Vi\u00f1a Tondonia is a significant upgrade in quality. Noticeable more oak flavours than the Gravonia due to the longer time (6 years vs 4 years) spent in oak barrels. I think the oak will better integrate overtime. While this wine is 12 years old, it still feels young, and seems like it has a lot of life ahead.\n\nAfter opening, it was a little closed on the pop and pour but opened up very nicely over a few hours. I had a couple glasses right after opening and revisited it a few hours later and it was much more powerful. I highly recommend drinking it on the cooler side, I have found for this wine and the Gravonia, the warmer the wine gets the more the alcohol comes out and you start to lose some of those lovely tertiary flavours. Luckily I have a number of the 2013\u2019s left which I imagine will get even better with age.\n\n95 points",

Very light powdery tannins. Good freshness. Definitely not the acidity or style of Burgundy, but actually despite being fuller and riper (Mediterranean) this danced on the right side of freshness. Very moreish.\n\n93+",

Blind it, and it might lead you to Meursault. There's fruit, density, volume and substance to this wine, which you don't get in most Chablis in my opinion. With a tad more length and lift, this would be a stunner. There might be a vintage effect at play, 2018 being a hot vintage.

    "Review": "A splendid supertuscan from Montalcino at less than 60\u00a3, impressive drinkability\n\nThe wine is a dark ruby showing all the cabernet sauvignon used. Pretty luminosity under the light.\n\nThe nose is defined by the cabernet sauvignon first: blueberry, morello cherry, and blackcurrant. Time in the glass is going to show both oak usage and cabernet franc: balsamic notes of anis, sandalwood, tobacco, licorice, and cinnamon. Some tertiary flavors (meat) start to come into the picture but we are still away from the minimum aging required for such notes to start being the stars of the show.\n\nIn the mouth, the wine has a powerful entrance, with high acidity and beautiful high tannins, yet still a bit unripe. However, the wine dance in the mouth, the acidity lifts the sip and matches beautifully with the body and alcol level (mid+ to both). The aftertaste is long, dominated by morello cherry and blackberries.\n\nOpened too young? for sure. This wine can stay in the cellar for another 10 years without losing a sweat. And yet, the wine is delicious today, it is very easy drinking while being a perfect match for important meat-based dishes. at < 60\u00a3 in 2025 it's hard to find better super tuscan blends.",

    "Review": "Day 1: Dark magenta in color with slight bricking and a clear water rim. The nose fairly generous and exudes impressions of matured red and purple fruits with peppery spice, tobacco and mild vegetal qualities. The initial impression on the palate is lean and intense profile most likely derived from the alcohol (15% ABV) which does not really distract but certainly noticeable. The silky tannic presence is still quite evident at this juncture in its development. In terms of mouthfeel, this red CDP is on the higher end of medium-bodied, masculine and expressive although the fruit has fade a somewhat which leaves a slight sense of hollowness which is especially pronounced in the middle palate. The flavor component includes matured red and purple fruits nicely framed with a blend of green and red peppers woody spices, vegetal qualities, tobacco leaf that leans towards bitter leaves (such as dandelions), very well-integrated oak and interesting menthol-inflected finish but no discernible minerality which is rather surprising. A very interesting wine but I think it would been much better experience if I had tasted this wine at an earlier age (say 5 - 7 years earlier) with more intense fruit to play with the other components. Purchased this bottle in Hong Kong back in 2019 barely a month before the wake of Pandemic. It's been quite a while since I had a CdP. I will revisit this again tomorrow to see how this evolves. (92)\n\nDay 2: the receding fruit is more evident tonight, otherwise the rest of the vital components continue to remain firmly intact. The wine has taken in a more savory turn which is tolerable but compounded with the weak fruit structure makes it somewhat annoying. (90)\n\nDay 3: an interesting sweet phenolic nose has emerged tonight. Moreover the fine-grain tannins, oak, peppery spices and earthy mineral components have also become dominant especially towards the backend and finish which is quite nice in spite of the fading fruit. Overall, this wine tasted much bigger, bolder, fuller and yes, more alcoholic than the previous nights tastings. (92)",

    "Wine Name": "NV Wagging Finger Oude Genever Excercise v2.0",
    "Review": "A small-batch craft genever based on moutwijn (\"malt wine\") composed of malted barley (50%) and malted rye (50%) and which has been aged for 2 months in an old Fino Sherry cask. The malt wine component was blended with distilled grain spirits flavored with juniper, angelica root, beetroot, caraway, coriander, dill, Sarawak pepper and other spices. 38% alcohol. Bottle #108 of total 243 bottles.\n\nClear, almost colorless to slightly grayish appearance. The nose feels EXACTLY like a gin with a strong hit of juniper and pine resin along with some grassy green notes, a little bit of pine needles and a hint of fragrant spices. Basically all the finer nuances get overwhelmed by the juniper notes. The genever feels intense, somewhat medicinal and quite sharp on the palate with a rather full body and intense flavors of juniper and grassy herbal notes, some alcohol heat, light waxy tones, a hint of medicinal bitterness and a touch of pine resin. The finish is long, green and robust with an intense aftertaste of juniper, some vegetal grassy tones and a little bit of herbal spice.\n\nThis is a very intense and robust genever, but to be frank, in a tasting of 13 genevers, this tasted more like gin than genever - all the other genevers seemed more mellow and subtle with very understated juniper nuances, whereas this was all about very intense juniper notes. On paper, this seemed very interesting with its oak-aged malt base component and lots of different spices, but honestly, in the nose and on the palate, this was virtually identical to a London Gin. Very atypical effort for a genever. Perhaps it works nicely as a stand-in for a gin in a cocktail, but on its own, I wasn't really a fan.",

    "Review": "Got the opportunity to drink this wine whilst the winemaker dialed into the dinner and discussed the challenges of the 2016 vintage and a broader evolution in his winemaking philosophy. Was compared to the 2021 vintage, except with less knowledge of how to deal with this particular kind of weather 'in extremis'.\n\nI felt that, given the circumstances, this was a triumph of the winemaking (though, perhaps, not a pure expression of terroir like the 2000 that came before it). This wine was really well built, leaving no doubt of its Grand Cru origins. Not too much in the way of spice or ripeness (a timely reminder that all wine is at the mercy of the weather), but the density of the core and the acidity from what material was there meant that this was in some dire need of oxygen to allow the tannins to round themselves out into something resembling a cohesive drinking experience. Only got to 93 on the very last sips, where the fruit final managed to peak its head.\n\nTruthfully, this is more like a 92 plus, and I think that this will be great one day, but never something that wine lovers are going to chase with any serious gusto. Give this level of skill in vinification to the more recent ripe vintages, however, and I think that you absolutely will. A delicate one to get the drinking window right on.",

The label on the Gros Karambolage bottle is also quite out of ordinary: it has a Captcha that says \"I'm human.\". Jonas explained this as a reflection on the challenging harvest and winemaking conditions of the year, and he simply wanted to state that he's only a human!\n\nAlso interesting to note that Jonas himself considers both of his Karambolage wines to be roses!

I found this to be super tight (moreso than others, it seems), and frankly even with oxygen I could not shake the notion that this wine is going through a closed phase. However, not impossible to rule out the role of a winemaking philosophy that churns out drinking windows that would make Bordeaux blush.\n\nThere is good reason as to why this commands the lowest price of the Roumier single-appelation wines, and many great Morey St Denis 1er wines should catch your attention before this one.

Though wines from Morey St. Denis are not generally the juiciest, this managed to express some very pure fruit. Though some 2019s have been relatively light on the density in the early drinking window, this did not have that problem at all. The finish was of a very pleasing length, and it was here that the whole-bunch heavy vinification made itself feel known.\n\nFor some at the event, their first encounter with Dujac, and one I was very pleased to facilitate.

One can hardly time this to be drank in the right moment or have the right bottle at the right time (however this may be quite a common thing for Montrachet).

Thick and oily this maintained plenty of freshness still and demonstrated all the characteristics of a top white Burgundy. The honey texture and aftertaste is quite prominant and it's very special. What's interesting is that the passionfruit and mango is so strong that an almost red flower like nose is presented. Incredibly refreshing and youthful given its age but of course I do not think it's wise to hold on further on this bottle. In absolute terms this is a great wine but I hardly think it can justify the hefty price tag (and probably no wine can justify so).

My tasting note reflects two things: Sufficient exposure to air via a serious decant (here three hours including a 30 minute car ride), and an understanding of what a mature white Rioja should taste like. I supplied the air, and my distinguished tasting group supplied the tasting experience Gravonia gravitas. On opening, this wine appeared to be an overl oxidized mashup of petroleum and quince jam. With air, the reductive elements loosened up and the wine revealed something very different. Highly fragrant honied yellow fruit and bees wax greets you before a sip, which then reveals a massive wine with an almost oily texture, bursting with so many elements that it\u2019s difficult to describe. There is lemon zest, candied almonds, roasted hazelnuts, quince, chamomile tea, candied ginger, peach pit, ripe nectarine, and yellow flowers. The acidity is preserved but subtle, and there is no discernible sweetness, which seems so unusual for wine with all of these elements, yet this was bone dry. If you\u2019re lucky enough to have some left, please treat it with care and he will be greatly rewarded.",

Perfect balance, harmony, complex aromas, complex flavors, dense and structured ,but... yesterday I had Paul Jaboulet Ain\u00e9 Crozes - Hermitage and I'm telling you it was great wine with a lot of surprises and excitement.\nNone of them are here. Nice, very well done, \"polite\" wine.\nEasy come, easy go, memorable no doubt about it. 70\u20ac versus 35\u20ac.\nThe smell is lovely. Minerals, flowers, forest, blackcurrant blackberry cedar, kirsch liquor.\nThe taste is about the same.\nStrong flavors of red cherry, black berry minerals and much more.\nVery long, soft finish.\nNice, but... you guessed - no excitement.\nI think the wine doesn't have enough spice, tobacco and other \"rough\" components.\nMy conclusion - this wine is definitely not worth its high price.\nThis 18 year old wine is at its peak. It won't get any better. Acidity and tannins are in full symbiosis with flavors.\n2006 got 87 points in Graves according to the WA Vintage Guide.\nAbove Average to Excellent.

Ce vin repr\u00e9sente l'expression toscane d'un assemblage bordelais, \u00e9labor\u00e9 avec la pr\u00e9cision et le savoir-faire qui ont fait la r\u00e9putation de cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nAspect Visuel: Robe d'un rubis profond et intense aux reflets violac\u00e9s, typique d'un vin encore jeune mais d\u00e9j\u00e0 concentr\u00e9. La couleur est opaque au centre avec une l\u00e9g\u00e8re transparence sur les bords.\nNez: Le bouquet est riche et complexe, s'ouvrant sur des notes intenses de fruits noirs (cassis, m\u00fbre, cerise noire) soutenues par des nuances de prune fra\u00eeche. L'\u00e9levage en bois apporte des ar\u00f4mes \u00e9l\u00e9gants de vanille, de c\u00e8dre et d'\u00e9pices douces. Avec l'a\u00e9ration se d\u00e9veloppent des notes balsamiques, d'eucalyptus, d'iode et de r\u00e9glisse, ainsi que de subtiles touches m\u00e9diterran\u00e9ennes de garrigue et de laurier.\nBouche: L'attaque est ample et soyeuse, r\u00e9v\u00e9lant un vin structur\u00e9 mais d\u00e9j\u00e0 accessible malgr\u00e9 sa jeunesse. La mati\u00e8re est dense avec des tanins fins et bien int\u00e9gr\u00e9s qui promettent une belle \u00e9volution. L'\u00e9quilibre entre puissance et \u00e9l\u00e9gance est remarquable, soutenu par une acidit\u00e9 fra\u00eeche qui apporte tension et longueur.\nLes saveurs reprennent le registre des fruits noirs m\u00fbrs, enrichies de notes de cacao amer, d'\u00e9pices grill\u00e9es et d'une touche min\u00e9rale rappelant le graphite. La finale est longue et persistante, l\u00e9g\u00e8rement r\u00e9gliss\u00e9e, avec une belle fra\u00eecheur qui invite \u00e0 la d\u00e9gustation.\nConclusion: Le 2021 Tua Rita Giusto di Notri exprime avec brio l'excellence du terroir de Suvereto et le savoir-faire du domaine. Ce mill\u00e9sime combine harmonieusement la richesse m\u00e9diterran\u00e9enne et la structure bordelaise pour offrir un vin d\u00e9j\u00e0 s\u00e9duisant mais promis \u00e0 une belle \u00e9volution.",

A good lift and length, in an ethereal style. This seems to currently be between two ages. But then a few hours of air may help...

    "Review": "A \"moutwijnjenever\" aka. genever distilled from moutwijn, aka. beer made only from malted barley, not unmalted grain. All malts used here are farmed organically. 35% alcohol.\n\nCompletely colorless, crystal-clear appearance. The nose feels surprisingly robust - the lack of the more neutral unmalted grain component is noticeable - with somewhat green-toned aromas of malty grains, some grassy and herby tones, a little bit of soot, light vegetal matcha nuances, a hint of stone dust and a grappa-like touch of fusel alcohols. The genever feels silky smooth and somewhat neutral yet still characterful and a bit robust on the palate with grainy malt notes, some funky fusel notes reminiscent of awamori or grappa, a little bit of stone dust, light juicy notes of white fruits and a hint of alcohol warmth. The finish is somewhat mild and slightly warm with a moderately long aftertaste of grainy malt character, some grappa-like notes of fusel alcohol, a little bit of stony minerality and a hint of green herby character.\n\nMost jonge jenevers are often quite simple, neutral and linear, at least to my taste, but this genever made with a malt base seems to add a nice, somewhat less neutral and more grainy character to the overall flavor profile. However, what was interesting was that genevers are supposed to be flavored with junipers - and there was no obvious juniper taste here whatsoever. Maybe those faint green vegetal notes came from junipers? Whatever the case, this was a somewhat mellow yet still a bit robust genever with no noticeable juniper character. I liked it.",

Rather light looking (a bit better than some) but has good flavour including a good mix of red berries, red cherry even pomegranate notes. Even a hint of savoury complexity. I appreciate the fruit, mild tannins, good acidity and reasonable length. For A$23 the QPR is reasonable. I don't understand the remarks on the label about being bottled in South Australia from Otago material. How does that work? The end result is a reasonable QPR. Perhaps not cellar-worthy for much duration but this is probably not part of the intent of the makers.",

The structure is there to last and the tannins has a bite, but there is a little bit of heat on this one. Tonight this got beaten by Benantis Rovittello from 2014. In comparison the heat was more pronounced and the fruit felt broody and bold, perhaps unfair but on elegance this one lost the battle. But wine is not a competition. There is plenty to love here, just be cautious of serving temperature here, and pair it with some creamy parmegiano packed risotto and you'll be fine. I prefer cooler years of this one. Still one of the best Barolos in the world. Hands down.",

Beautiful nose of rose petals, light touch of VA (acceptable), grape-gummy carbonic character on the palate. Thought it had a streak of green at one point but turned out that was mostly from the bittergourd YTF I was eating. Juicy. A low intervention Burgundy I can actually get behind, and not entirely ridiculously priced too (approx $80). There is a Pacalet connection here as he helped make the wines for a few years before the incumbent came of age, although I haven\u2019t tried much of his wines so just leaving that as a bit of trivia without further comment.",

This was not bad at all at open, showing some age in color and an interesting nose of dark red fruits and scorched earth, with similar profile on the palate. Tannin is there but not overpowering. Better with 45 minutes to warm and open a bit more, but probably really hit its stride at the 2 hour mark (but plenty to enjoy before that, in particular with food). With 2 hours of air this shows more of the dark red fruits, with the fruit being on the ripe side - just short of roasted. The tannins soften and become more lush and the wine expands on the palate with time. Very nice, but short of great. In the window but will last for a long time. A-",

Gazin 2009 in a private setting back in 2012 to be quite on the same level of quality as the Ch. Petrus of the same vintage, I went straight to my wine dealer and grabbed a case of 12.\n\nOver the years, I opened a bottle once in a while, and so did yesterday - the wine being now 15 years old (when is the birthyear of a wine anyway: The year the grapes were harvested, or the year it was \u201efinished\u201c and botteled\u2026?).\n\nI admit that I am not really a right-bank guy - although there are quite a lot of cases of St. Emilions and Pomerols of recent vintages in my celler, waiting to be opened - but I would expect a Merlot-based wine to be quite accessible, with a fruity aroma, round and smooth tannins and a touch of hedonistic sexyness compared to a Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated claret - especially after 15 years in the bottle.\n\nWell - the Ch. Gazin 2009 never really presented itself to me as a typical Pomerol - or as what I expected a Pomerol to be - but I would accept every criticism that puts me right.\n\nThe nose very nice out of the decanter after 1h, with warm tertiary aromas of earth and (maybe?) truffle. Very promising!\n\nThe palate was a bit disappointing. The tannins are still super present but with a dry touch on my tongue and teeth. Nice acidity but not perfectly balanced. Quite a bit of grip after 15 years, and not that silky and smooth texture I hoped for.\nNot disturbing, but it reminded me more of a very Carbernet based left-bank wine of the 2005 vintage, for example. Never ever would I have guessed that this was 90% Merlot. As I said - I am not yet very experienced in Merlot.\n\nLater, when I drank the wine with the meal (Steak) - as intended - it was more harmonious, better. Especially together with the Seasalt on the meat it developped quite nicely and was smoother with more pleasurable aromas.\n\nSo, as a wine to accompany a hearty meal, it performed well and was very good. My wife drank 2 glasses - which is a proof that it was enjoyable.\n\nFor itself - without food - it was still very good but a little bit austere in texture.\n\nPS:\nThe wine was better the next morning:\nMuch sweeter and smoother, with complex aromas.\nSo I guess it needs more air - or more years in the cellar.",

Initially the primary red fruits were to the fore but gamey, tertiary elements began to develop fairly quickly. A great accompaniment to a veal t-bone in mushroom sauce. We were sad to see the end of our last bottle. Ended up with a nose of smelly socks and a leather earth palate so great Pinot.",

Sweeter tart flavored red fruits but not too bold or tart. Acidity is there but tannins show a lot more in its present state. Pretty long finish. Nose isn\u2019t giving much at the moment. Could be too cold or just hasn\u2019t been exposed to air lonf enough. Would recommend giving this a few years before opening a bottle. Will see what air might do to open this up a lil more.",

    "Review": "I opened the 2018 of this first but it had TCA, \u201dcorked\u201d. I still noted some comparisons and will share that as it was.\n\nTwo very different wines, I can feel that even though the 21 is only being opened because of a slight cork damage on the 18. Perhaps it\u2019s unfair to assess the 18 based on what I perceive as its character independent of the cork issue, but it feels rustic and a bit rough around the edges. It could be the cork, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s what makes the fruit feel more like black tea stalky, tannin-rich, and leaning more towards dark cherry. Meanwhile, the 21, which has been de-stemmed and comes from this cooler vintage, is very elegant, with red raspberries, strawberries, lingonberries, but also orange zest, sous bois, violets, and a bit of herbaceousness. Good acidity, powdery tannins. A very fine C\u00f4te de Beaune, Elodie\u2019s Santenay Gravi\u00e8res has stood head and shoulders above her other wines I\u2019ve tried and is quite a find in Burgundy.",
